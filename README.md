# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

# Overview
This project is centered around creating a machine learning-based solution for detecting credit card fraud, a major issue for financial institutions. The primary goal is to accurately identify fraudulent transactions, which is vital in reducing financial losses. The focus is on developing a dependable and efficient system for fraud detection utilizing various machine learning methodologies.


# Dataset
We use the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, which is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). This dataset contains a collection of features from credit card transactions, including time, amount, and anonymized features (V1-V28). The target variable, 'Class,' indicates whether a transaction is legitimate (Class 0) or fraudulent (Class 1).
