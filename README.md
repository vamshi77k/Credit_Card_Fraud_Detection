# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

# Overview
This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model for credit card fraud detection. Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions, and accurate detection of fraudulent transactions is crucial for minimizing financial losses. This project aims to build a robust and reliable fraud detection system using machine learning techniques.


# Dataset
We use the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, which is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). This dataset contains a collection of features from credit card transactions, including time, amount, and anonymized features (V1-V28). The target variable, 'Class,' indicates whether a transaction is legitimate (Class 0) or fraudulent (Class 1).
